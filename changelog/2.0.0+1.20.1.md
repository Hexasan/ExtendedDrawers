* Ported to 1.20
* New YACL + json config system
* Lots more configuration options
* Drawers setting changing items are now controlled by tags
* Replaced downgrade with limiters
* Updated many old textures
* Hidden mode now looks way better
* Added duping mode (aka creative vending)
  * It's a toggle instead of upgrade, because once you get one you can dupe it anyway
