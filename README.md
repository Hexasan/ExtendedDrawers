# Extended Drawers
A mod inspired by storage drawers that aims to allow for easy creation of powerfull yet not
overpowered storage using simple components.

## Features
### Drawers
Drawers are blocks that can store a lot of a few item. They are available in 1, 2 and 4 slot
configurations. They can be interacted with in world or using hopper or pipes from other mods.
They can be locked using a drawer key which will stop the item in the drawer from changing until 
it's unlocked.

### Controllers
Drawer controllers are blocks that can interact with multiple drawers that are connected to them
within 64 blocks. They only support insertion in world, but can be extracted from using pipes
and hoppers. They can also be used to lock a large amount of drawers at the same time.

### Shadow Drawers
Shadow drawers show the amount of a resource that is available in the whole network and allows
for insertion and expansion of that resource, but they are only available in the 1 slot
configuration.

### Capacity Upgrades
Capacity upgrades are items that extend the capacity of a drawer slot. Only a single upgrade can be 
installed at a time. They are planned to be available in 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x versions.
